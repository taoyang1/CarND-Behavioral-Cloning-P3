    "### Files Submitted & Code Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Submission includes all required files and can be used to run the simulator in autonomous mode\n",
    "\n",
    "My project includes the following files:\n",
    "* model.py containing the script to create and train the model\n",
    "* drive.py for driving the car in autonomous mode\n",
    "* model.h5 containing a trained convolution neural network \n",
    "* writeup_report.md and writeup_report.pdf summarizing the results\n",
    "* video.mp4 which contains **TWO** laps of autonomous driving footages\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Submission includes functional code\n",
    "Using the Udacity provided simulator and my drive.py file, the car can be driven autonomously around the track by executing \n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python drive.py model.h5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Submission code is usable and readable\n",
    "\n",
    "The model.py file contains the code for training and saving the convolution neural network. The file shows the pipeline I used for training and validating the model, and it contains comments to explain how the code works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. An appropriate model architecture has been employed\n",
    "\n",
    "My model consists of a convolution neural network based on the NVIDIA architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Attempts to reduce overfitting in the model\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was trained and validated on different data sets to ensure that the model was not overfitting (code line 33). The model was tested by running it through the simulator and ensuring that the vehicle could stay on the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Model parameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "The model used an adam optimizer, so the learning rate was not tuned manually (model.py line 98).\n",
    "The number of epochs is tested manually to make sure both the validation and training loss decreases monotonically. As a result, nb_epoch = 3 is chosen. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Appropriate training data\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data was chosen to keep the vehicle driving on the road. I used a combination of center lane driving, recovering from the left and right sides of the road, adjusted left and right camera data, and a reverse lap data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For details about how I created the training data, see the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture and Training Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Solution Design Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall strategy for deriving a model architecture was to build on an existing deep neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first step was to use a convolution neural network model similar to the LeNet. I thought this model might be appropriate because track 1 is relatively simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gauge how well the model was working, I split my image and steering angle data into a training and validation set. I found that my first model had both large mse. This suggests I'm underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combat the underfitting, I adopted the NVIDIA model so that it's more complex. Now it's better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I add the normalization and cropping layer to better pre-process the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also augmented the training data by taking the left and right camera data. A correction term is add/subtracted from the original steering angles. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final step was to run the simulator to see how well the car was driving around track one. There were a few spots where the vehicle fell off the track. To improve the driving behavior in these cases, I collect more data focused on recovery from left and right and also a reverse lap driving data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the process, the vehicle is able to drive autonomously around the track without leaving the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Final Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model architecture (model.py lines 80-93) consisted of a convolution neural network with the following layers and layer sizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A data normalization layer (model.py line 82).\n",
    "2. A cropping layer where the top 55 pixels and bottom 25 pixels are dropped (model.py line 83).\n",
    "3. A conv2d layer with 5*5 filter sizes, stride of 2, depth of 24 and a RELU activation layer (model.py line 84).\n",
    "4. A conv2d layer with 5*5 filter sizes, stride of 2, depth of 36 and a RELU activation layer (model.py line 85).\n",
    "5. A conv2d layer with 5*5 filter sizes, stride of 2, depth of 48 and a RELU activation layer (model.py line 86).\n",
    "6. A conv2d layer with 3*3 filter sizes, stride of 1, depth of 64 and a RELU activation layer (model.py line 87).\n",
    "7. A conv2d layer with 3*3 filter sizes, stride of 1, depth of 64 and a RELU activation layer (model.py line 88).\n",
    "8. A fully connected layer with 100 outputs (model.py line 90).\n",
    "9. A fully connected layer with 50 outputs (model.py line 91).\n",
    "10. A fully connected layer with 10 outputs (model.py line 92).\n",
    "11. Final output with 1 continuous output being the steering angle (model.py line 93).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Creation of the Training Set & Training Process\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture good driving behavior, I first recorded 6 laps on track one using center lane driving. Here is an example image of center lane driving:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "I then recorded the vehicle recovering from the left side and right sides of the road back to center so that the vehicle would learn to recover from drift to the left or the right. These images show what a recovery looks like starting from the left or right.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recover from left **\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recover from right **\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I did not use track two in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "To augment the data sat, I include both data from the left camera and the right camera. Their corresponding angles are obtained by adding/substracting a constant correction (0.25) to the center angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also collect a reverse lap driving data to compensate the left steering bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the collection process, I had 50546 of data points. I then preprocessed this data by normalization and cropping.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I finally randomly shuffled the data set and put 20% of the data into a validation set. \n",
    "\n",
    "I used this training data for training the model. The validation set helped determine if the model was over or under fitting. The ideal number of epochs was 3 by inspecting the loss plot below. I used an adam optimizer so that manually training the learning rate wasn't necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "![loss plot][image5]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Video\n",
    "\n",
    "The final testing video is in [this](https://github.com/taoyang1/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3) git repository. Note **TWO** laps of autonomous driving is captured."
